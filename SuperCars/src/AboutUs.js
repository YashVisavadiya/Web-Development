            Supercars.net was started by Richard Owen and Daniel Guillamot in
            1996. Together they put one of the first automotive pages on what
            was, at the time, a very spacious world wide web. In late 2015, a
            small team of dedicated “car nuts” took over and will hopefully
            continue to grow the community.

            We couldn't care less what lap time cars can do at the Nurburgring,
            or how much they weighs, or whether there are those who will
            typecast its driver. We want cars that are joyous to drive, purely
            for the sake of driving. We want escapism that if were brutally
            honest, probably won't be possible much longer. For us, it is about
            an enjoyment, excitement and fascination with cars that deliver
            unique and precious driving experiences.
